An Analysis of the Relationship between Tree Coverage and Pedestrian-Involved Crashes Near Schools in Washington, D.C. (2019-2023)
This study employed a quantitative analysis to understand the relationship between tree coverage and the number of pedestrian-involved crashes near schools in Washington, D.C. across five years. It is hypothesized that there is a negative relationship between tree coverage and the number of pedestrian-involved crashes near schools in D.C. Thus, schools with higher levels of tree coverage are expected to have fewer crashes. Data on tree coverage and crashes in Washington, D.C. were pulled from public databases, and three software platforms were used to clean, transform, join, analyze, and visualize data. A linear regression model was run to test the statistical significance and direction of the relationship between tree coverage and the number of pedestrian-involved crashes. Based on this analysis, there is a significant and slight negative relationship between tree coverage and pedestrian-involved crashes, suggesting that it is a viable component of holistic strategies to reduce crashes in D.C.
